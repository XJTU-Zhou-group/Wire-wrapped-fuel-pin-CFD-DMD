1.This file include the snapshot matrix of U+, V+, W+ and P in the middle cross section.
  
  The snapshot matrix of U+, V+, W+, P are Data_u, Data_v, Data_w, Data_p, respectively.
  
2.compute_DMD_wirewrap.m is the main function of DMD method, and it contains the way to output variable information as .txt.
  and it contains the mehtod to cauculate the confficient of determination(R^2).

3.The midplane.dat contain the xyz position of each point and the grid information in cross section (The format of Tecplot).

4.If you want to post process in Tecplot, you have to paste the variable information in txt file to midplane.dat.(For example midplane_DMD.dat and midplane_real.dat)
  midplane_real.dat is CFD result, midplane_DMD.dat is DMD prediction.
